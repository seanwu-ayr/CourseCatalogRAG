Answer: The prerequisite for CSEN/COEN 12, the Abstract Data Types and Data Structures class, is a grade of C- or better in CSEN/COEN 11.Question: What will I learn about in that course?
Answer: In the CSEN/COEN 12 course, you will learn about abstract data types and data structures. The course covers data abstraction, information hiding, and interface specification. You will learn about basic data structures such as stacks, queues, lists, binary trees, hashing, tables, and graphs, and how to implement these abstract data types in the C language. The course also includes a review of internal sorting methods like selection, insertion, exchange sorts, quicksort, and heapsort, and covers recursion. You will also learn about the analysis of run-time behavior of algorithms and Big-O notation. The course introduces you to classes in C++.Question: Explain those data structures you listed
Answer: Sure, here's a brief explanation of each data structure:

1. Stack: A stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which operations are performed. The order may be LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out).

2. Queue: A queue is a kind of abstract data type or collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order and the principal (or only) operations on the collection are the addition of entities to the rear terminal position, known as enqueue, and removal of entities from the front terminal position, known as dequeue.

3. List: A list is a collection of items where each item holds a relative position with respect to the others.

4. Binary Trees: A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

5. Hashing: In hashing, large keys are converted into small keys by using hash functions. The values are then stored in a data structure called hash table.

6. Tables: A table is a data structure that organizes information into rows and columns. It can be used to both store and display data in a structured format.

7. Graphs: A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph. 

These data structures are used in programming to organize and store data in a way that enables efficient access and modification.Question: What are the prereqs for COEN 12?
