Admission to one of the school’s master’s degree programs and completion of at least the first 12 units of that program prior to completion of the undergraduate degree
Undergraduate research with completion of 6 or more units of CSEN/COEN 193 (cannot also be used to satisfy a CSEN/COEN elective)
12 or more units approved by an academic advisor. The courses must be part of a theme or be in the same department, and may not also be used to satisfy other requirements of the student’s primary major.
