Eskafi, Angela MusurlianThe Department of Computer Science and Engineering offers major programs leading to the bachelor of science in computer science and engineering, or the bachelor of science in web design and engineering. The computer science and engineering program features a balanced core in which each student studies the engineering aspects of software and hardware as well as the mathematical foundations of computation.
